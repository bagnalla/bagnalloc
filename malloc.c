 * @date March 4, 2016
 * @brief File containing implementations of malloc(), free(), calloc(), and realloc().
 *
 * These functions can be used as a general-purpose replacement for the equivalent standard library functions (or so I think - may be unsafe in some way).
 * In my testing this implementation seems perform the same or better than the standard implementation except for heavy parallel allocation (less efficient usage of mutex I guess)
 * The memory overhead for block metadata is also larger than the standard implementation which is most noticeable when doing a lot of small allocations.
 * The heap size is managed via the glibc sbrk() function. Allocation requests >= 128kB are allocated via mmap instead of growing the heap.
 * Thread safety is guaranteed via a pthread mutex.
 * Beware though, errors will not result in a nice exception like bad_alloc.
